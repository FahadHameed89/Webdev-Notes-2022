<h2>What is is this place?</h2>

<p>This is a place where I will save a bunch of code notes, examples, and micro projects for quick reference in the future as I go through freecodecamp.org. It might be better to do it in a single repository so that the notes will evolve with my development skills. It is definately my intention to keep returning to this repository, update this page with more notes as I learn more. </p>
